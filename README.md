## Features

* Domain reputation analysis using a whitelist/blacklist approach.
* Text-based fake news detection using a logistic regression model.
* Real-time analysis via Chrome extension interface.
* Visual reliability scoring via progress bar and textual feedback.
* Reporting system for users to flag suspicious articles.
* Local storage of reports for review.

## How It Works

1. When a user opens a news article and clicks the "Analyze" button:

   * The extension checks the current page URL.
   * If the domain is in a known list (trusted/fake), it returns a quick result.
   * If unknown, the extension sends the article text to a FastAPI backend.
   * The backend uses a trained model to analyze the content and return a prediction.
2. Results are presented in the popup with a reliability score and label (real/fake).
